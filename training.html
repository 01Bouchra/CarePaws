    <h2>For dogs :</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Basic Commands : Teach simple commands like sit, stay, and come using treats or praise when they do it correctly. Keep sessions short and practice regularly.</li>
      <li>Potty Training : Take your dog outside at the same times each day and reward them when they go in the right spot. Be patient with accidents—punishment slows learning.</li>
      <li>Walking Manners :Stop walking if your dog pulls on the leash, and continue only when they walk calmly by your side. Short, consistent practice works best.</li>
      <li>Behavior & Discipline : Redirect unwanted behavior, like chewing or excessive barking, by giving a toy or removing attention. Reward calm, good behavior consistently.</li>
